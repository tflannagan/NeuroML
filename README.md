# NeuroML

NeuroML is an interactive visualization tool that combines neural network modeling with machine learning concepts. It provides a dynamic, visual representation of neural network behavior and evolution.

## Live Demo

## Features

* Dual canvas visualization:
  - Simulation canvas: Displays the real-time behavior of the neural network
  - Model canvas: Shows the structure and connections of the neural network
* Interactive controls for simulation management:
  - Start/Stop button to control the simulation
  - Reset button to reinitialize the simulation
  - Evolve button to trigger evolution of the neural network
* Adjustable simulation parameters:
  - Simulation speed control
  - Mutation rate control for evolution
* Real-time statistics display
* Responsive design with a futuristic aesthetic

## How to Use

1. Open the NeuroML application in a web browser
2. Click the "Start" button to begin the simulation
3. Use the speed slider to adjust the simulation speed
4. Click the "Evolve" button to trigger network evolution
5. Adjust the mutation rate using the provided slider
6. Click "Reset" to restart the simulation with a new configuration
7. Observe the real-time statistics and visualizations on both canvases

## Technical Details

* Built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
* Utilizes the TensorFlow.js library for neural network operations
* Canvas-based visualization for both simulation and model representation
* Responsive layout using flexbox
* Custom styling with a cyberpunk-inspired color scheme

## Future Enhancements

* Add more complex neural network architectures
* Implement different types of machine learning algorithms
* Provide more detailed statistics and performance metrics
* Allow users to save and load different network configurations
* Backend configurations
